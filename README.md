<p>This is an example of an application that implements a long press listener
to a Google Map, in this application when the user long presses on the
map, the application will display a dialog box asking the
user which version of the map that would like to view it in. <br/>
The two views are:
<ol>	
	<li>Standard</li>
	<li>Satellite</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>The following image shows the dialog box that is
presented to the user when the user long presses on the map,
as you can see the default view is set to the Standard view.

<p>After the user has chosen the second option the map view will change
to show the following map view.
