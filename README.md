<p>This is an example of an application that implements a long press listener
to a Google Map, in this application when the user long presses on the
map, the application will display a dialog box asking the
user which version of the map that would like to view it in. <br/>
The two views are:
<ol>	
	<li>Standard</li>
	<li>Satellite</li>
</ol>
